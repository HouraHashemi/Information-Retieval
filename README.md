## Features

- Implementation of various information retrieval algorithms.
- Support for text processing and analysis.
- Tools for indexing and querying large datasets.
- Evaluation metrics for information retrieval systems.
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and experimentation.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HouraHashemi/Information-Retieval.git
cd Information-Retrieval
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system.

## Usage

The repository is organized into several modules and notebooks. Here is a quick guide on how to use the key components:

### Text Processing

You can preprocess text data using the `text_processing.py` module:

```python
from text_processing import preprocess_text

text = "Your raw text here."
processed_text = preprocess_text(text)
print(processed_text)
```

### Indexing and Querying

Index documents and perform queries using the `indexing.py` and `querying.py` modules:

```python
from indexing import Indexer
from querying import QueryProcessor

# Indexing documents
indexer = Indexer()
indexer.index_documents(documents)

# Querying
query_processor = QueryProcessor(indexer)
results = query_processor.search("your query here")
print(results)
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate your information retrieval system using the `evaluation.py` module:

```python
from evaluation import evaluate

evaluation_results = evaluate(retrieved_documents, relevant_documents)
print(evaluation_results)
```
